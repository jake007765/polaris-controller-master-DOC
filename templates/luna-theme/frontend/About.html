            <h1>Meet Reporter</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1951, Reporter Magazine is a completely student run organization through the Rochester Institute of Technology. The magazine is a daily online publication and a 32 page full-color issue printed on the first Friday of the month for the duration of the academic year. Business, editorial and design facilities are located in Room A-730, in the lower level of the Campus Center. </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h3>
